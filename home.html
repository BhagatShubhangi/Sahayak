    <p>The crowdsourced disaster reporting tool is designed to improve the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of disaster response through real time, community driven data collection. Traditional disaster response methods often suffer from delays and lack of real time information. Our tool aims to bridge the gap by empowering citizens to report incident and share critical information quickly.</p>
